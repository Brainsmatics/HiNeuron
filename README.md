Reconstructing neuronal morphology is vital for classifying neurons and mapping brain connectivity. However, it remains a significant challenge due to their complex structure, dense distribution, and low image contrast. 
This program is used for axial interpolation of neuron images to obtain isotropic images. 
The voxel resolution in the three directions of the xyz is different, and the voxel resolution in the z-axis is lower. 
Therefore, a high voxel resolution image in the z-axis is obtained through neural network prediction.
